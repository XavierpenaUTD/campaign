## Description

Campaign: The Puzzle Quest is a Python game created using the Pygame library. Inspired by classic adventure games, this project focuses on simple room navigation, puzzles, keys, and switches to create a small but complete player experience.

The player explores multiple connected rooms, solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles to find and collect the hidden treasure. Along the way, players must:

- Collect keys to unlock locked doors
- Push blocks to solve a puzzle and unlock access to new rooms
- Activate a switch to open the gate blocking the treasure
- Avoid obstacles and navigate the environment
- Collect the treasure to win the game and trigger animated particle effects and victory screen
- Replay or quit using the in-game restart and quit options

### Project Files

- `project.py`: The main Python script containing the game logic and code.
- `requirements.txt`: The list of required Python libraries to run the game. (This project only requires `pygame`.)
- `README.md`: This file, which describes the project, its contents, and how to run it.

### Design Considerations

This project was designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, while still adding layers of gameplay and polish:

- **Puzzles and Progression**: Keys, switches, and block pushing provide variety and goals for the player.
- **Visual Feedback**: Color changes, animations, and particle effects provide player feedback and enhance the experience.
- **Replayability**: A clean victory screen with "Play Again" or "Quit" options make it easy to restart or exit.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only the Pygame library is required for easy installation and running.

### Future Areas of Improvement

- Add sound effects and background music to increase immersion.
- Add more puzzle types or enemies for variety.
- Add player health or timers to increase challenge.
- Implement save/load functionality for longer play sessions.
- Create a title screen with additional game options and settings.

This project was an excellent exercise in Python and Pygame programming, game design, and project iteration. It demonstrates core gameplay mechanics, polish, and readability.
